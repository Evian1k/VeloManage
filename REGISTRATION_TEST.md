# 🧪 **REGISTRATION TEST - IGNORE CONSOLE WARNINGS**

## ⚠️ **Those Console Warnings Are Normal!**

The warnings you see are **NOT errors** and **won't prevent registration**:

1. ✅ **React lifecycle warnings** - From dependencies, not blocking
2. ✅ **React Router warnings** - Future version warnings, harmless  
3. ✅ **Toast prop warning** - Fixed! Minor UI issue

**These are development warnings only - they don't affect functionality!**

### **Step 1: Fill Out Registration Form**
```

❌ **FAILURE CASE:**

## 🔍 **If Registration Still Fails:**

**Look for these specific error messages:**

### **"Please fill in all required fields"**
- Solution: Make sure all fields are filled

### **"Passwords do not match"**  
- Solution: Check password and confirm password are identical

### **"User already exists"**
- Solution: Try different email/phone OR clear browser storage

### **"Registration failed: [specific reason]"**
- Solution: Tell me the specific reason shown

## 🧹 **CLEAR STORAGE IF NEEDED:**

If you get "User already exists" error:

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Application tab**
3. **Find Local Storage → http://localhost:5173**
4. **Delete all keys** starting with `autocare_v1_`
5. **Refresh page** and try again
